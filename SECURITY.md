# Security Policy

This document outlines our security policies and procedures for the CSS Challenges project.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all components of the CSS Challenges project, including:

* The repository itself (code, documentation, etc.)
* Any associated websites or services
* Any communication channels related to the project (e.g., issue trackers, forums)

**Supported Versions**

**As this is a static repository of code examples, there are no specific versions to support.** However, we encourage users to use the latest stable versions of their browsers and development tools to ensure compatibility and security.

**Reporting a Vulnerability**

We appreciate responsible security disclosures. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the CSS Challenges project, please report it to us privately by emailing us at (oussama.mansouri@issatm.ucar.tn).

**Please include the following information in your report:**

* **Description:** A detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it.
* **Impact:** The potential impact of the vulnerability (e.g., data exposure, denial of service).
* **Proof-of-concept (optional):** If possible, please provide a proof-of-concept (PoC) to help us reproduce the vulnerability. Please note that we may not be able to test all PoCs.

**Upon receiving your report, we will:**

* **Acknowledge receipt:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within [ timeframe, e.g., 2 business days ].
* **Investigate:** We will investigate the reported vulnerability and determine its severity.
* **Coordinate a fix:** If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work to develop and test a fix.
* **Release a patch:** If applicable (e.g., if the vulnerability affects a supporting tool or service), we will release a patch as soon as possible.
* **Inform you:** We will keep you informed of the progress of our investigation and the release of any patches.

**Note:**

* As CSS Challenges primarily consists of static code examples, the risk of security vulnerabilities is generally low. 
* However, it's still important to have a process for reporting and addressing any potential issues.

**Disclaimer:**

This security policy is subject to change at any time. We encourage you to review this document periodically for updates.

**Note:**

* This updated version removes the "Supported Versions" section as it's not applicable to a static code repository.
* It emphasizes the low risk of security vulnerabilities in this specific context.
* It clarifies that any fixes would primarily apply to supporting tools or services, if applicable.

I hope this revised version better suits the "CSS Challenges" project!

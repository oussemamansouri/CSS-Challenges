  <h1>CSS Overflow Examples</h1>

  <!-- Example 1: Overflow set to "visible" -->
  <div class="example-container">
    <h2>Overflow: visible</h2>
    <div class="box visible">
      This content is very long and will overflow the box. You can see how it extends 
      outside the container when overflow is set to "visible". The text is now much bigger 
      to clearly demonstrate the overflow behavior.
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Example 2: Overflow set to "hidden" -->
  <div class="example-container">
    <h2>Overflow: hidden</h2>
    <div class="box hidden">
      This content is very long and will overflow the box. However, it is clipped because 
      overflow is set to "hidden". The text size has been increased for better visibility.
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Example 3: Overflow set to "scroll" -->
  <div class="example-container">
    <h2>Overflow: scroll</h2>
    <div class="box scroll">
      This content is very long and will overflow the box. Scrollbars are added to let you view 
      the entire content. The text size has been increased to highlight the effect.
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Example 4: Overflow set to "auto" -->
  <div class="example-container">
    <h2>Overflow: auto</h2>
    <div class="box auto">
      This content is very long and will overflow the box. Scrollbars are added only if necessary.
      The larger text helps demonstrate this behavior effectively.
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Example 5: Separate control for horizontal and vertical overflow -->
  <div class="example-container">
    <h2>Overflow-x and Overflow-y</h2>
    <div class="box xy">
      This content is very long and will overflow the box. Here, we are controlling the overflow 
      separately for horizontal and vertical directions using overflow-x and overflow-y. The larger 
      text helps emphasize the effect.
    </div>
  </div>

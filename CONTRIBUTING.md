This guide outlines the contribution process for CSS Challenges, including how to submit challenges, code style guidelines, and testing practices.

## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to CSS Challenges:

* **Submit a new challenge:** We welcome new challenges of all difficulty levels. Please refer to the 'Challenge Structure' section below for formatting guidelines.

* **Provide feedback:** We value your feedback! If you have any suggestions for improvement, please feel free to create an issue or leave a comment on a pull request.

## Challenge Structure

Each challenge should be presented in a clear and concise manner, following this structure:

* **Challenge Folder:** Create a new folder for each challenge. The folder name should be descriptive and reflect the challenge's focus (e.g., flexbox-layout, advanced-transitions).
* **Challenge Description (.md file):**
    * **Title:**  A clear and concise title that accurately reflects the challenge.
    * **Problem Statement:**  A detailed description of the challenge, outlining the desired outcome and any specific requirements.
    * **Difficulty Level:**  Indicate the difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) to help users identify appropriate challenges.
* **Solution Files:**
    * **HTML (.html file):**  A basic HTML file that serves as the foundation for the challenge.
    * **CSS (.css file):**  The CSS solution file that demonstrates how to achieve the desired outcome.

## Code Style

For consistency and readability, please adhere to the following code style guidelines:

* **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces for indentation.
* **Spacing:** Add a single space after commas, semicolons, and colons.
* **Naming Conventions:** Use camelCase for variable and function names, and kebab-case for class names (e.g., backgroundColor, flexbox-container).

## Testing

It's important to ensure that your challenges and solutions function as intended. Here are some suggestions for testing:

* **Manual Testing:** Manually test your challenges in different browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
* **Code Linters:** Consider using a CSS linter like Stylelint to catch potential errors and enforce coding standards.

* **Clear Description:**  Provide a clear and concise description of your changes in the pull request description.
* **Code Formatting:**  Ensure your code adheres to the style guidelines outlined above.

# CSS Challenge 28: Grid Layout Model

## ðŸ§© Challenge Description

Your task is to create a simple **3x3 CSS Grid layout** that represents a basic dashboard. Use the **CSS Grid Layout Model** to position 9 different sections.

### Layout Structure

|       |       |       |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Header (1) | Header (2) | Header (3) |
| Content (4) | Main (5) | Content (6) |
| Footer (7) | Footer (8) | Footer (9) |

### Requirements

- Use `display: grid` to create a 3x3 grid.
- Each cell should have equal width and height.
- Add different background colors to distinguish each section.
- Include a simple border for visual separation.
- Text should be centered both vertically and horizontally in each grid item.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Practice creating grid containers and items.
- Use grid properties like `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, and `gap`.
- Apply styling and alignment techniques within a grid.

## ðŸ’¡ Bonus

- Add hover effects that slightly scale the sections.
- Make the layout responsive so it stacks on smaller screens (e.g., using `grid-template-areas` or media queries).

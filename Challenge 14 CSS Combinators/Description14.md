# Challenge 14: CSS Combinators

##  Description:
In this challenge, you will practice using different CSS combinators to style elements based on their relationships. Your task is to apply styles using the following combinators:
- **Descendant selector** (` `)
- **Child selector** (`>`)
- **Adjacent sibling selector** (`+`)
- **General sibling selector** (`~`)

## Instructions:
1. Create a `div` element that contains several child elements (`p`, `ul`, and `h2`).
2. Apply the following styles using the given combinators:
   - Use a **descendant selector** to style all `p` elements inside the `div` with a yellow background.
   - Use a **child selector** to style direct child `p` elements of the `div` with a light blue background.
   - Use an **adjacent sibling selector** to style the first `p` element immediately after the `div` with a light green background.
   - Use a **general sibling selector** to style all `p` elements that are siblings of the `div` with a light coral background.

## Requirements:
- Style all `p` elements inside the `div` (descendant selector) with a **yellow** background.
- Style the direct child `p` elements of the `div` (child selector) with a **light blue** background.
- Style the first `p` element immediately following the `div` (adjacent sibling selector) with a **light green** background.
- Style all `p` elements that are siblings of the `div` (general sibling selector) with a **light coral** background.

# CSS Challenge 26: Build a Responsive Pricing Table Using Flexbox

## Objective
Create a responsive pricing table using **CSS Flexbox**. The table should feature three pricing plans (e.g., "Basic," "Standard," "Premium") with corresponding titles, prices, and features. Use Flexbox for layout and alignment.

---

## Instructions
1. Design an HTML structure that includes:
   - A title for each pricing plan (e.g., "Basic," "Standard," "Premium").
   - A price for each plan (e.g., "$10/month").
   - A list of at least three features per plan.
   - A "Sign Up" button for each card.

2. Use **Flexbox** to:
   - Horizontally align the cards on larger screens.
   - Stack the cards vertically on smaller screens (responsive behavior).
   - Center the content inside each card.

3. Add **styling** to make the table visually appealing:
   - Use padding, borders, and hover effects on the buttons.
   - Assign a distinct background color to each card.

4. Ensure the layout is fully **responsive**, adapting gracefully to different screen sizes.

## Requirements
- Use only **CSS Flexbox** for layout and alignment.
- Write clean and semantic **HTML**.
- Incorporate responsive design principles.

---

## Expected Output
- On larger screens: The pricing cards should appear in a row.
- On smaller screens: The pricing cards should stack vertically.
- Each button should have a hover effect for interactivity.

---

## Bonus
- Add smooth animations when a user hovers over a pricing card.

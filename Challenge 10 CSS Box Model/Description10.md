# Challenge 10: CSS Box Model

## Description

The CSS Box Model is an essential concept in CSS layout and design. Every HTML element can be thought of as a box, and the box model governs the space around it, which includes content, padding, borders, and margins.

Your task is to create a simple webpage that demonstrates how the box model works. You will apply different padding, border, and margin values to see how they affect the overall size and spacing of an element.

## Instructions

1. Create a `div` element with text inside it.
2. Apply the following styles:
   - Set a width and height for the content area.
   - Add padding around the content.
   - Add borders around the element.
   - Add margins to create space around the element.
3. Calculate and display the total width and height of the element based on the box model (width + padding + border).

## Example

Given a `div` with:
- Content width: 320px
- Padding: 20px on all sides
- Border: 5px on all sides

Calculate the total width and height, and display the result below the `div`.

# Challenge 09: CSS Outline 

## Objective
In this challenge, you will explore the different types of outlines in CSS by applying various outline styles, colors, widths, and offsets to an HTML element. Your goal is to practice how outlines differ from borders and how they are used to make elements stand out.

### Instructions:
1. Create an HTML file with a `div` element that has some content inside.
2. Apply different outline properties to the `div` to style it as follows:
   - Set an outline style using `outline-style`.
   - Set the outline width using `outline-width`.
   - Set the outline color using `outline-color`.
   - Add some space between the outline and the border using `outline-offset`.
3. Experiment with the following outline styles:
   - `solid`
   - `dotted`
   - `dashed`
   - `double`
   - `groove`
   - `ridge`
   - `inset`
   - `outset`
4. Ensure that the outline does not affect the elementâ€™s total dimensions.

### Requirements:
- Your `div` should demonstrate **at least 3 different outline styles**.
- Set a unique color for each outline using `outline-color`.
- Adjust the `outline-width` and `outline-offset` for each style to create visual distinction.
  
### Bonus:
- Add a second `div` to show how outlines can overlap or affect surrounding content.

Good luck, and make sure the element's outline stands out!
